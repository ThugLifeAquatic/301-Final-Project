devEstate is a fancy homepage for developers.

In it's current form, users can use the page by simply entering thier github username on the landing page.

This gives the user access to devEstates functionality.

The website uses the username to display the current users most recently updated github repositories via the github public api.

There is also integrated note taking compatability, intended primarily for quick reminders that the user can reference.
Notes are stored in a database for future use.  Currently, notes can only be added and retrieved.

The bottom section of the site displays coding challenges from codewars, to encourage users to keep developing thier skills.
Users can click on a challenge and it will be rendered in an iframe.  There, they can preview the challenge, or even complete it if they so choose.
